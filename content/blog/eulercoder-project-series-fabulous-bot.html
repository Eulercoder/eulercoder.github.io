<p>Hello!</p>

<p>In our previous post, Eulercoder <a href="http://eulercoder.me/weekly-project/">announced our weekly project series</a> based on the feedback and suggestions from our readers. We had mentioned that we will be announcing our first project on Saturday — 16th September (2017) but there was a slight delay and today is a Sunday.</p>

<p>Today <a href="http://eulercoder.me/about">Eulercoder</a> is announcing the very first project in the<a href="http://eulercoder.me/weekly-project/"> weekly projects series</a>, The Fabulous bot for Slack. (Will be available for Messenger, Telegram too)</p>

<h3 id="the-idea">The Idea</h3>

<p>Most of the top companies and startups are already using Slack and on an average, in the weekdays, people stay active on Slack for almost 5–6 hours. Fabulous Bot is a bot which does the basic work of searching from different platforms and showing the results directly in your Slack channel. Users don’t have to leave Slack, open browser and search for something.</p>

<p><strong>User will be able to</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Search from Google, Wikipedia, YouTube etc—( top 3 results will be shown)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check weather of any city</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Search Query from Stack Overflow</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Get commits data of any repository, Branch or pull request</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Get stocks data</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Search images from Google Images, Flickr etc</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do mathematical Calculations</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check meaning of words — From Urban Dictionary</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>View maps</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and will be able to perform lot more tasks.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-are-we-going-to-implement-this">How are we going to Implement this?</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>User will call fabulous Bot as <code class="highlighter-rouge">_\fabulous service_name Query_</code>. We will read the service name and Query.
<em>Ex- </em><strong><em>Service_name</em></strong><em> = YouTube, </em><strong><em>Query</em></strong><em> = despacito</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of these services have APIs available. We will call those APIs and get the results.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parse the results in the Slack response format.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And post in the Slack channel.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>What is API is not available? </strong>Then we will use BeautifulSoup (mostly) or Flask to scrap the results form the source code.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;code class="language-python"&gt;query = quote(query)
url = "https://encrypted.google.com/search?q={0}".format(query)&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<ol>
  <li>Here <em>quote</em> function formats the query and using beautiful soup, we are scraping that URL. You can copy that URL and try it in the browser. It works!</li>
</ol>
