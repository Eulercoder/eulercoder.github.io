	     <p>I read a blog post and now I’m inspired by <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/">John Resig</a> (Who was in turn, inspired by <a href="http://jenniferdewalt.com/">Jennifer Dewalt</a>), I am going to write code every day, starting today. I hope to write about my coding progress regularly on this blog.</p>

<h1 id="why-i-intend-on-writing-as-i-go-along">Why I intend on writing as I go along</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Obligate me to actually code every day (though this may not work because this blog has practically no readership)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keep a log of my progress over time</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recall the reasoning I used when justifying decisions (e.g. this list describes why I decided to blog while doing this)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<!-- more -->

<h1 id="what-i-hope-to-gain-from-this">What I hope to gain from this</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Better programming skills and intuition. Improved familiarity with tools, paradigms, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improve my algorithmic knowledge.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learn new languages, frameworks etc. by application rather than just reading docs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create some interesting projects, hopefully, some worth mentioning in a <a href="http://eulercoder.me/2017/07/slack-internship-sf-silicon-valley/">technical interview</a> or something (for those “describe a time you ran into a problem when programming and how you fixed your problem” type questions)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spend free time more productively (as of now, coding seems like a much more useful way of spending my free time than chatting on WhatsApp or watching prank videos on YouTube)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Meet people, become more familiar with the many programming communities on the internet.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="ideas-what-to-do-each-day">Ideas what to do each day</h1>

<p>This section is more of just a brainstorm/dump of different ways I can code each day.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Learn a new language or framework. On my to-learn list: Dart, Go, R and other JavaScript web frameworks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Solve problems on different Coding platforms and Interview problems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Play with APIs and write tools for myself and the community.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contribute to Open Source projects.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="what-are-the-projects-currently-im-working-on">What are the projects currently I’m working on</h1>
