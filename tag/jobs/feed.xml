	     <p>In Summer 2016, I had applied to 20+ companies for Software engineering internships. Twelve companies sent me that same <a href="https://www.greenhouse.io">Greenhouse</a> rejection template, three companies said their summer internship positions are full and I got shortlisted for five companies, S.</p>

<p>[This post was written before summer 2016]</p>

<p>I had already started my internship at <a href="https://www.codechef.com">CodeChef</a> (Jan’16 - April’16), my daily schedule is 8 - 4 PM college and then 4:30 - 9,10 at CodeChef. I reach home by 11-11:30, so I used to sleep late and bunk lectures in college to prepare for the interviews. I have written about the<a href="http://eulercoder.me/2017/07/summer-internship-ultimate-guide/"> interview preparation plan, books and resume tips here </a>read it after completing this post, Let’s discuss about the interview process today.</p>

<h3 id="mozilla">Mozilla</h3>

<p>I applied to <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US">Mozilla</a> through <a href="https://careers.mozilla.org/">career website</a> for multiple internship position in many places. I got shortlisted for Developer Tools (Device Simulation) and Engineering Build Productivity intern positions in Paris and Mountain View respectively. For both positions first round was on <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com">Hackerrank</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There were 4 - 5 multiple choice questions and two coding problems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For each MCQs, you need to give an explanation as well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Questions were very easy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allowed languages depends on the position you’re applying to. For me, allowed language was JavaScript only.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Questions can be found <a href="https://goo.gl/hX8QU6">here</a> .</p>

<p>I got rejected for a Developer Tools (Device Simulation) Intern position in Paris after the first round and moved to the second round for Engineering Build Intern (Mountain View).</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Second round was on Skype.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Interview was a bit more technical but easy. I had to write <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-recursive-function-to-print-reverse-of-a-linked-list">C program to reverse a singly linked list</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And interviewer asked me about my projects and internship.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I had performed well but I don’t know why they replied with this ‘we appreciate your commitment to Mozilla, we will unfortunately not be moving forward at this time.’ I said OK :p.</p>

<h3 id="browserstack">Browserstack</h3>

<p>I applied through career website and got a response after almost 20 days. First round was on <a href="https://www.hackerearth.com">Hackerearth</a> . There were total three problems to solve in three hours.</p>

<p><strong>Problems</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>XPath Query Parse</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Docs Generator</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Server Log Analysis</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Among all my first rounds this was the most challenging. Detailed questions can be found <a href="https://goo.gl/2OTWXM">here</a>. I could solve just one problem in three hours and they rejected me.</p>

<h3 id="amazon">Amazon</h3>

<p>I got shortlisted for Amazon internship two times. Last year they asked me if I’m available for six months internship which wasn’t possible so I said No. This time I got shortlisted again for 3 months internship. Applied through career care website and received a response from them after 15 - 20 days.</p>

<p>The first round was on Hackerrank. There were total 2-3 problems to solve in an hour.</p>

<p><strong>Problems</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-for-balanced-parentheses-in-an-expression/">Parenthesis Matching problem </a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-c-program-to-find-the-maximum-depth-or-height-of-a-tree/">Longest Path in Binary Tree</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I don’t remember the third problem.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Problems were easy, I solved all the three problems and moved to next round.</p>

<h3 id="slack">Slack</h3>

<p>I had moved to the second round of Amazon internship and suddenly one day BAM! <strong>Subject</strong> : ‘Phone Interview with <a href="https://www.slack.com">Slack</a>!. I wasn’t expecting this as no internship positions were mentioned on the website. I had mailed them my resume only because I really love the product and wanted to work on it. Read this : <a href="http://eulercoder.me/2016/02/21/Slack-the-evolution-of-messaging/">Slack the evolution of messaging</a>.</p>

<p>Now I was just focusing on this internship, I didn’t want to lose this one.</p>

<h4 id="interview-process">Interview Process</h4>

<p>There were total fours rounds. I can’t write about the question but here is the summary of it.</p>

<p><strong>First round</strong></p>

<p>First round was with the recruiter it was kind of behavioral interview.</p>

<p><strong>Second Round</strong></p>

<p>In the second round I was given a coding assignment with two tasks to complete in a week. Both the tasks were of medium level one Coding task and one design problem. This depends on the position you’re applying for.</p>

<p>I completed both tasks in 3-4 days and they took 4-5 days to review my solutions. I got a mail after a week saying I’m moving to the next round. Now this was very exciting I started working hard for the next interviews. Next interview was with my mentor and senior engineering manager. I solved almost 50+ problems in 3-4 days on different coding platforms like <a href="https://leetcode.com">LeetCode</a> and <a href="http://www.topcoder.co">TopCoder</a>. I was expecting it to be very technical.</p>

<p><strong>Third Round</strong></p>

<p>Third round was with the Manager and it wasn’t very technical.</p>

<p><strong>Fourth Round</strong></p>

<p>After, a week I got an email saying I’m moving to the next round. Now this was so exciting and I was trying my hardest. Fourth round was very surprising. We talked about the company and my previous interviews. Finally, I was offered the internship on call.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus Read:</strong> <a href="http://eulercoder.me/2017/07/slack-internship-sf-silicon-valley/">Summer Internship Experience, San Francisco and Silicon Valley</a></p>

<p>Frankly telling I had never imagined that I’d intern in the US. I accepted the offer and will be joining the company in June. Recruiting team is very friendly and helpful. I’m very excited to join the Automation and Testing Team this summer at Slack. [This post was written in 2016]</p>

<h3 id="linkedin">LinkedIn</h3>

<p>While I was interviewing with Slack (Third round), I got shortlisted for the LinkedIn Internship too. They send me a link of a coding challenge on Hackerrank. I wanted to solve the coding challenges. There were total 3 problems to solve in 3 hours.</p>

<p><strong>Problems</strong></p>

<p>I can not share the full problem statements but problems were purely algorithmic.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Angry Children</strong>: Distribute X candy packets to K children. A greedy problem.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>ZigZagArray</strong>: Print Array in Zig Zag manner based on some conditions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Acme Substring</strong>: String Based problem.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>After the first round I mailed them about my Internship at Slack.</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://eulercoder.me/2017/07/summer-internship-ultimate-guide/">Getting a great summer internship</a> should absolutely be your first priority, nothing else will beat the things you’ll learn and experience. The amount of impact you’ll end up having cannot be matched easily, especially as a student. As a third year student it was my first priority too. I applied to 20+ companies from Best of the best to average companies. One thing that I learnt in these three years is that networking is really important. You should talk to employees, recruiters and alumni. Tell them what you’re doing currently, tell them about your projects, past experiences and publicize it on sites like <a href="https://www.producthunt.com">ProductHunt</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hackernews</a>.</p>

<p>There are so many opportunities available so the first step to getting an internship, is apply. A lot of people I know are just too afraid to apply, even to companies they really want to work at because they are waiting to get the perfect resume. Even I used to feel the same thanks to <a href="http://krishmunot.com">Krish Munot</a> he’s an awesome guy! Last year in december we were discussing about the internships.</p>

<p>Here is our short discussion on FB:</p>

<p><em><strong>Me</strong></em>: <em>I’m thinking of applying for the internship .. next sem for the full time</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Krish</strong></em>: <em>Don’t think. Just apply. Most people make this mistake of not applying. Did you apply for the summer?</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Me</strong></em>: <em>No..not sure whether they would shortlist me.</em></p>

<p><strong>Krish</strong>: <em>That is there decision bro. Maybe they might think you might be the right fit. Damn! Dont do this ever again man..trust me! You are losing out on a lot of opportunities like that.</em></p>

<p>And this was true! Thanks to my family and friends for all the support.</p>

	     <p>As a student, each one of us has a dream. Dream of doing a great internship and landing a job in a company that you really love and want to work for! There are jazillion websites, articles, blog posts and videos available on how to land an internship. Chances are, you’ve already read or known 98 percent of this advice: edit and proofread your resume and cover letters, dress appropriately for an interview, be on time or 15 minutes early to an interview, send thank you notes etc. You won’t get any such advice in this blog post. This post will take you from zero to one. Get a notebook and pen, this is going to be a long post. Grab some snacks and start making a note of points that you think would be helpful for you in the future.</p>

<p>I’m assuming you are currently in the second year and you’ll be applying for your dream internship in the third year. You already know C/C++ or any object oriented programming knowledge and basics data structures like Linked List, Stack, Queues etc.</p>

<p>Let’s divide the blog into three sections.</p>

<!-- more -->
<h3 id="things-you-need-to-do-before-applying-for-an-internship">Things you need to do before applying for an internship.</h3>

<p>Most of the US based companies start their summer internship interview process very early, in December. After your fourth semester that is the completion of the second year, you’ll have 1.5-2 months of vacation (depends on your college) and that’s the perfect time to improve your basics of computer science and coding skills.</p>

<p>I interviewed with 5-6 companies and from my experience here is the list of topics you should know (if you haven’t decided your field).</p>

<p>I’m not listing here very basic stuff like Working with Ubuntu, Curl and telnet command etc.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You don’t need to do know everything mentioned in the table above. Algorithm and Data structure is very important to crack any interview so you should spend most of the time learning and practice problems.</p>

<h4 id="vicky-thats-a-huge-list-are-there-any-good-resources-available">Vicky, That’s a huge list! Are there any good resources available?</h4>

<p>Yes! All the useful websites, PDFs and article links are mentioned at the end of the post.</p>

<hr />

<p>Getting shortlisted for the interviews is the toughest part and for that, your resume should be very strong and of very high quality. So what are the different factors that the recruiter would love to see on your resume?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>College</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Projects</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, before applying for an internship make sure that you have some good quality projects to mention in your resume. Upload your code on <a href="https://github.com/vicky002">Github</a>, make it open source and add links to code in your resume. If you’re searching for project ideas, I have a list of <a href="https://github.com/vicky002/1000_Projects">more than 500 projects</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Open Source Contributions</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Search for good projects to <a href="https://github.com/explore">contribute on Github</a> improve documentation and fix bugs and do some enhancements. Companies really love it! If you don’t have a good GPA then projects and open source contributions really add value to your resume.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Past internships</strong> (If any)</li>
</ul>

<p>Before applying to top companies in US or India, you should do at least one internship in any startup. Startup internships are really a great place to learn a lot of things in a very short time. Don’t think of stipend, if you really love their idea just email and ask them about internship positions. There are many websites available for startup internships list of websites can be found at the bottom of the post.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Leadership Qualities</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Volunteer in a nonprofit organization and be a part of college committees.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Programming Skills</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>GPA</strong> (rare)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="things-you-need-to-do-while-applying">Things you need to do while applying</h3>

<p>Ok, now you have some good quality projects, you know basics of CS fundamentals and you have a good knowledge of data structure and algorithms. This is time to write a good resume!</p>

<p>Your resume should have following sections.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Education</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Degree and stream, College Name, Current year and graduation year. Don’t include your GPA if it’s less than 7/10.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Skills</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Be honest here and mention languages and framework only if you really know. Once you get shortlisted for the interviews, the recruiter may ask any questions on that and you’ll be messed up badly.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Technical Experience</strong> (If you have any)</li>
</ol>

<p>Write sentences in past tense. Use words like ‘created’, ‘implemented’, ‘designed’, ‘fixed’. Implemented X using Y or Implemented X using Y to fix Z. Where X = any new feature, Y = language or framework, and Z = issue.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Projects</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Same points apply to project as well. Don’t forget to add links of code or websites if you have any.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Leadership Experience</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Add your volunteering or committee work in this section.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Extra-Curricular</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>All your competitive programming rankings, awards, and Hackathon related stuff goes here.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Work Authorization</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>You’ll be applying to US based companies so don’t forget to add this line.</p>

<p>I haven’t updated my resume since last two month but have a look at it once. Ignore objective section it’s just a waste of space.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vicky002/vicky002.github.io/602d6292eb0a5e6ab7d6ef0c65c194097bbc52fc/img/Resume.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once you created your resume, proofread it 2-3 times. Ask your friends and employees to go through your resume and finally post your resume <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/">here</a>. This subreddit is awesome and people are very helpful. It’ll be brutal but they’ll critique your resume brilliantly.</p>

<hr />

<p>Now you have a very good resume and you know all basics of CS. The time has come to apply for best of the best internships!</p>

<h3 id="this-is-the-right-time">This is the right time!</h3>

<p>Yes! This is December 2016 and Internship process for Summer 2017 has just started. I have already created a sheet for you! Open <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-0M50QEHjB64WhdcMFDlAbp4atND8QrlWJwKkfpNJ2k/edit?usp=sharing">this sheet</a> and make a copy for yourself. Edit companies as per your preferences.</p>

<p>Apply everywhere! Don’t think that you don’t have a perfect resume, just visit their career website or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/vsearch/j?keywords=Internship&amp;title=Internship&amp;sb=Jobs%20for%20Internship%20titles&amp;trk=tyah&amp;trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Asuggestion%2CclickedEntityId%3A166%2Cidx%3A1-1-1%2CtarId%3A1457835727447%2Ctas%3Ainternship%20">LinkedIn internship posts</a> and fill the form. I applied to <a href="http://eulercoder.me/2016/02/27/My-internship-interview-experience-with-Amazon-LinkedIn-BrowserStack-Mozilla-and-Slack/">more than 20 companies this year</a>.</p>

<p>Once you get shortlisted for the interviews search the everywhere about past internship interview process, questions on Glassdoor, Geeksforgeeks and reddit. When I got shortlisted for the internship at Slack, I searched everywhere about interview process and questions asked. I couldn’t find any except a post on reddit. If you don’t find anything and just goto <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/">this sub</a> and post questions or search for past interns on LinkedIn add them in your profile and message them directly. Three out of ten people will give you perfect reply and this is enough for you!</p>

<p>Some tips from my side:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Read emails properly and search for keywords.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be prepared for technical questions which don’t require programming knowledge.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be polite while responding to emails. (Search how to send emails to recruiters :p)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before interviews read the email properly and make a list of all the questions that can be asked.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make a list of all the behavioral questions and their answers.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I have collected some interview experiences of top companies from different resources. I hope you find <a href="https://www.evernote.com/pub/tvicky002/interview">this</a> useful.</p>
